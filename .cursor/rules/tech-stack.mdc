A. Tech Stack
   - Python 3.10 only
   - PostgreSQL (no JSON/NoSQL)
   - Plain HTML + vanilla JS front end

B. Architecture
   - Maintain the current folder structure
   - Single entry point: main.py
   - Don’t touch .env without permission

C. Coding Style
   - Keep functions under ~60 lines
   - Avoid files over ~400 lines
   - PEP 8 standards + docstrings

D. Testing
   - Use pytest for every new feature
   - No stubbed/mocked data in production
   - Fix existing code/tests before adding new patterns

E. Deployment
   - Must pass tests before deployment
   - Don’t alter the hosting setup unless asked
   - No big refactors of CI/CD flows without a reason

F. Safety & Cleanup
   - No duplicated logic—extend existing code
   - Delete any “temporary” scripts when done
   - Never commit real secrets to version control

G. Packages & Dependencies
   - No new library overlap with existing ones
   - No removal/replacement of libraries unless absolutely necessary

H. Summaries
   - Summarize major changes after each commit
   - Provide a quick “how to test” for big features

I. Error & Edge Cases
   - Handle bad inputs/timeouts gracefully
   - Log or raise meaningful exceptions (don’t silently swallow errors)
